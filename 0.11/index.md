<p class="message-notice">Version 0.11 is still being developed, and the documentation is a work-in-progress.</p>

**league/commonmark** is a Markdown parser for PHP which supports the full [CommonMark spec](http://spec.commonmark.org). It is directly based the [CommonMark JS reference implementation](https://github.com/jgm/CommonMark/tree/master/js) by [John MacFarlane](http://johnmacfarlane.net/) ([@jgm](https://github.com/jgm)).

## Goals

While other Markdown parsers focus on speed, or try to enable a wide range of flavors, this parser will strive to match the C and JavaScript implementations of CommonMark to make a logical and similar API.

We will always focus on CommonMark compliance over speed, but performance improvements will definitely happen during efforts to reach v1.0.0 and afterwards.

## Customization

This library allows you to add custom directives, renders, and more.  Check out the [Customization](/customization/overview/) section for more information.
