# Upgrading from 1.3 to 1.4

There are no major changes introduced in 1.4.

## Deprecations

Several things have been deprecated in 1.4 - they'll continue to work, but consider using alternatives to make your code easier to upgrade to 2.0 when these deprecated things are removed.

### `bin/commonmark` command

This command has been buggy to test and is relatively unpopular, so this will be removed in 2.0. If you need this type of functionality, consider writing your own script with a Converter/Environment configured exactly how you want it.

### `ArrayCollection` methods

This class has several unused methods, or methods with an existing alternative:

| Method Name         | Alternative                                          |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `add($value)`       | `$collection[] = $value`                             |
| `set($key, $value)` | `$collection[$key] = $value`                         |
| `get($key)`         | `$collection[$key]`                                  |
| `remove($key)`      | `unset($collection[$key])`                           |
| `isEmpty()`         | `count($collection) === 0`                           |
| `contains($value)`  | `in_array($value, $collection->toArray(), true)`     |
| `indexOf($value)`   | `array_search($value, $collection->toArray(), true)` |
| `containsKey($key)` | `isset($collection[$key])`                           |
| `replaceWith()`     | (none provided)                                      |
| `removeGaps()`      | (none provided)                                      |

### `Converter` and `ConverterInterface`

The `Converter` class has been deprecated - switch to using `CommonMarkConverter` instead.

The `ConverterInterface` has been deprecated - switch to using `MarkdownConverterInterface` instead.
